-- `db-sync` needs to match the implementation of the logic in `ledger-specs` even when that logic
-- is not actually correct (ie it needs to be bug compatible). Eg it was intended that a single
-- stake address can receive rewards from more than one place (eg for being a pool owner and a
-- pool member or rewards from two separate pools going to the name stake address). However, due
-- to a bug in `ledger-specs` all rewards other than the first are accidentally dropped (caused by
-- the use of `Map.union` instead of `Map.unionWith mapppend`). These missing rewards have since
-- been paid back with payments from the reserves.
